## Hi there üëã

I'm Hanjingxue Boling, one of the translators of the openSUSE Linux Chinese wiki and community news. I am currently a dual system user of Windows 10 and [openSUSE tumbleweed](https://www.opensuse.org/#Tumbleweed).

[Fedora Linux](https://getfedora.org/) and [openSUSE Linux](https://www.opensuse.org/) are my two favorite Linux distributions.

## Main business

My main business is translating [openSUSE community news](https://suse.org.cn/). Recently worked on another [documentation project](https://github.com/linuxhitchhiker/THGLG).

My personal documentation site and blog are detailed [here](https://hanjingxue-boling.github.io/Whiteboard/).

## Additional Notes:

You can call me Hanjingxue Boling, Hanjingxue, Boling H. or Boling Hanjingxue. the order doesn't matter because the virtual name doesn't include the last name.
