## Hi there 👋

I am Hanjingxue Boling (寒晶雪•铂灵), one of the Chinese translators of openSUSE news, and all articles are published under [CC-BY-SA 3.0/4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/) license if not otherwise stated. Since it is not possible to perform a password update on [this wiki account](https://zh.opensuse.org/User:Aua0880) to apply a more secure password. If you notice unusual behavior from this user, please contact an administrator or me as soon as possible.

I use Win10 on a daily basis and use Fedora Linux at the same time (Only insider [vbox](https://www.virtualbox.org/)). At the same time, I am not a developer.

Now, I am mainly translating openSUSE news and OpenBSD community documents.
